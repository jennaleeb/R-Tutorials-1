This is a collection of materials used for the R tutorials for MIE 1402 at the University of Toronto.

The site is Jekyll-powered based on the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo), customized for R-bloggers with the help of Yihui Xie's <a href = "https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll">knitr-jekyll</a>.
